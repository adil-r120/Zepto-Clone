# Zepto Clone

A small static demo project containing a Zepto-like clone.

Contents
- `zepto.html` — demo HTML file
- `zepto.css` — styles for the demo
- `images/` — image assets used by the demo

How to view
- Open `zepto.html` directly in your browser.
- Or serve the folder locally (recommended) and visit http://localhost:8000 in your browser. From PowerShell:

```powershell
cd 'C:\Users\mdadi\Downloads\Zepto clone'
python -m http.server 8000
```

Notes
- This is a static project (HTML/CSS/Images). No build step required.

GitHub Pages
- To host this on GitHub Pages, enable Pages in the repository settings and select the `master` branch (root) or add a `docs/` folder and select it.
